# Game Development To-Do List

## 1. Design Player and NPC Classes

### Player Class

- [ ] **Attributes**
  - [✓] `name`: The player's name or identifier.
  - [✓] `planets`: A list of planets owned by the player.
  - [ ] `research`: Technologies or upgrades the player has researched.
  - [ ] `fleet`: Ships or units owned by the player.

- [ ] **Methods**
  - [ ] `add_planet(planet)`: Add a planet to the player’s list.
  - [ ] `produce_resources()`: Collect resources from all owned planets.
  - [ ] `research_technology(tech)`: Start or complete research on a technology.
  - [ ] `build_fleet(ship_type, quantity)`: Construct ships and add them to the fleet.
  - [ ] `attack(target)`: Engage in combat with another player or NPC.
  - [ ] `defend()`: Organize defenses against attacks.

### NPC Class

- [ ] **Attributes**
  - [ ] `difficulty_level`: Determines the NPC’s strategy and aggressiveness.

- [ ] **Methods**
  - [ ] `make_decision()`: AI logic for deciding actions (e.g., attack, defend, expand).
  - [ ] `negotiate(player)`: Interaction with players for alliances or treaties.

## 2. Implement Fleet System

### Fleet Class

- [ ] **Attributes**
  - [ ] `ships`: A dictionary of ship types and their quantities.
  - [ ] `commander`: The player or NPC commanding the fleet.

- [ ] **Methods**
  - [ ] `add_ship(ship_type, quantity)`: Add ships to the fleet.
  - [ ] `remove_ship(ship_type, quantity)`: Remove ships from the fleet.
  - [ ] `engage(target)`: Initiate combat with another fleet or planet.
  - [ ] `calculate_power()`: Assess the fleet’s combat strength.

### Ship Class

- [ ] **Attributes**
  - [ ] `name`: Name or type of the ship.
  - [ ] `attack_power`: Offensive capability.
  - [ ] `defense_power`: Defensive capability.
  - [ ] `speed`: Travel speed.
  - [ ] `cost`: Resource cost to build.

## 3. Develop Defense Structures

### Defense Building Class

- [ ] **Attributes**
  - [ ] `defense_power`: Overall defense capability.
  - [ ] `shield_strength`: Additional protective measure.

- [ ] **Methods**
  - [ ] `upgrade()`: Enhance the building’s defensive capabilities.
  - [ ] `calculate_defense()`: Compute total defense based on level and enhancements.

## 4. Interaction and Combat Mechanics

### Combat System

- [ ] **Initiating Combat**: Define how and when combat occurs (e.g., player commands, NPC decisions).
- [ ] **Combat Resolution**: Develop logic for resolving battles based on fleet strengths, defensive capabilities, and random factors.
- [ ] **Rewards and Penalties**: Implement consequences for winning or losing battles, such as resource gain/loss or planet capture.

## 5. User Interface Considerations

### UI Elements

- [ ] **Entity Management**: Interfaces for managing players, fleets, and defense buildings.
- [ ] **Combat Display**: Visuals for ongoing battles and their outcomes.
- [ ] **Notifications**: Alerts for attacks, research completion, and other events.

## 6. Testing and Iteration

### Testing Strategies

- [ ] **Unit Testing**: Write tests for player actions, fleet management, and combat mechanics.
- [ ] **Simulation Testing**: Simulate AI behaviors and interactions to ensure NPCs act logically.
- [ ] **Balance Testing**: Playtest to find and adjust balance issues with resources, combat, and AI strategies.
